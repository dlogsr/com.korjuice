						<strong>Cold-Press Juicing</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>verb</em>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The act of making juice through a near decade old technique that extracts pure juice from fresh, raw fruits and veggies using a hydraulic press that applies a tremendous amount of pressure to extract the nectar directly from the pulp.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Cold Press juice extraction technique uses no heat, ensuring the vital enzymes, nutrients and minerals of the fruits and vegetables stay intact and aren’t cooked away.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Cold-Press Juicing is an upcoming trend. Chances are, you have seen or heard of a cold-press juice bar in your neighborhood. What used to be a hidden secret among advent juicers has slowly become more mainstream.

					<p>
						<strong>Our Story is very simple.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We are a group of aspiring cold-press juicers who want to revolutionize the world of juicing. As excited as we were to see the cold-press juicing trend starting to pick up steam, we found current juice bars have a common theme:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Juices are expensive.</li>
						<li>Juices can’t be customized.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						For us, this was an issue. How could we revolutionize the world of juicing if the juice is not affordable and customers can’t choose their own ingredients? This is where KOR Juice Bar comes in to the picture. We are simply a juice bar that seeks to address these two concerns among the Juicing Community. We are seeking to be the very first juice bar that allows YOU as the customer to pick the ingredients in your Juice. After all, it is your Juice!

					<ul>
						<li>
							“Great Concept! It really allows me to put exactly what I want in my Juice”
						</li>
						<li>
							“I am always a bit skeptical on what exactly goes into my Juice at current Juice Bars, I like your idea of being able to physically pick the fruits and veggies and hand it over to get juiced”
						</li>
						<li>
							“I love the idea of choosing my own produce and then watching my juice being made Fresh!”
						</li>
						<li>
							“I like the idea of being able to test unlimited recipes without having to go through all the trouble of buying it, washing it, juicing it!”
						</li>
						<li>
							“I like the fact there are ethnic fruits/ veggies! Juice Bars don’t really have that option”
						</li>
						<li>
							“Sometimes I go to a Juice Bar and they have a Juice on their Menu, and I want to switch out an ingredient, but they won’t let me!”
						</li>
						<li>
							“When I go to some Juice Bars, I always want to ‘mix and match’ a few recipes on their menu, but they won’t let me!”
